# Ceramic Protocol
[**Ceramic**](http://ceramic.network) is a permissionless protocol for creating tamper-proof documents. Ceramic documents are signed, append-only objects stored in IPFS, encoded using IPLD, and anchored in one or more blockchains. Ceramic's public document graph provides a single verifiable source of truth for building consensus around important documents, enabling participants to trustlessly share and efficiently coordinate around information in a platform-agnostic way. Ceramic documents support novel use cases such as self-sovereign identity, interoperable data ecosystems, and user-centric infrastructure that allow developers to build more open, composable apps.
