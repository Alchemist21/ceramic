# Ceramic Protocol
> [**Ceramic**](http://ceramic.network) is a permissionless protocol for creating and accessing mutable, tamper-proof documents that serve as the foundation for a web without silos. 

Ceramic documents are signed, append-only objects stored in [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs), encoded using [IPLD](https://github.com/ipld/ipld), and anchored in one or more blockchains. Ceramic's public document graph provides a single verifiable source of truth for building consensus around important documents, enabling participants to trustlessly share and efficiently coordinate around information in a platform-agnostic way. Ceramic documents support novel use cases such as self-sovereign identity, interoperable data ecosystems, and open web services that allow developers to build more open, composable apps.

## Contributing
The easiest way to get involved in Ceramic is to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/6VRZpGP), where we are very active.

To propose or contribute improvements to the core Ceramic protocol, such as adding support for additional doctypes, open an issue in the [ceramicnetwork/specs](http://github.com/ceramicnetwork/specs/issues) repository.

To propose or contribute improvements to the Ceramic JavaScript client, open an issue in the [ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic](http://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic/issues) repository.

To propose or contribute other feature requests or improvements that don't fit neatly into the above, such as creating an implementation in another language, open an issue in the [ceramicnetwork/ceramic](http://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/issues) repository.
